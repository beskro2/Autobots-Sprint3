-We updated the planetarium application where we fixed the defects we found and we added functionality to the original application as defined by the stretch goals 
-We provided an updated and condensed testing suite with the top most essential tests

Background
Defintion of a defect: A defect is anytime software does not function as intended. Further, "a defect is any failed requirement or deviation of an expected outcome. This could be a business requirement not being met, a software feature not working correctly, gaining access to resources you are not supposed to, etc."
We used the planetarium wireframe as a guide for our defect identification and our software requirement specification (SRS) document.
