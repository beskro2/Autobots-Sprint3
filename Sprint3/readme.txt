-We updated the planetarium application where we fixed the defects we found and we added functionality to the original application as defined by the stretch goals 
-We provided an updated and condensed testing suite with the top most essential tests

Background
Defintion of a defect: A defect is anytime software does not function as intended. Further, "a defect is any failed 
requirement or deviation of an expected outcome. This could be a business requirement not being met, a software feature not
working correctly, gaining access to resources you are not supposed to, etc."
We used the planetarium wireframe as a guide for our defect identification and our software requirement specification (SRS) document.  
Keeping in mind the testing principle "Exhaustive Testing is not possible" we have narrowed down our tests to the most critical
features for this final sprint.  See below:

Essential Tests:
1)Registration
2)Log in
3) Test for defect 'duplicate username' alert not present
4) Test for defect adding a planet or moon with a number in front, example: 90Planet
5) Test to delete planet
6) Test to delete moon
7) Test to add planet
8) Test to add moon
9) Test for successful log out
