Saumya-worked on stretch goals




Today:

Saumya - Got code reviewed by other team members for the description box, updated background, external link to Hayden Planetarium,and time feature in the homepage.  
Ran a new planetarium application that displays the error message with a duplicate username and allows for adding planets/moons 90Aries.  Got Jenkins up and 
running and produced first mvn test results after team members merged their code to github.  Also reviewed other team members' code.
