___________________________________
### What went well in this Sprint? 
- Clear Communication: Our daily stand-ups were productive and helped keep everyone aligned and focused on priorities. Combined with regular use of Teams and Jira made it easy to keep track of everyone's progress.
- Deep Understanding of Responsibilities: Each team member demonstrated a solid grasp of their individual responsibilities. We were able to efficiently test functionality in the repository and service layers for the planetarium, ensuring robust coverage.
- Organized and Readable Tests: We focused on organizing and formatting our tests for clarity, making them easily readable and maintainable. This approach also simplified the Git branch merging process, ensuring smooth integration of work.
### What can be improved for the next Sprint?
- Time Management: Several team members noted the need to better manage their time. Expressing a need to start our development process a little bit earlier to compensate for unexpected issues. One issue of note was the amount of time needed to perform code reviews and branch merging.
### What work needs to be done next Sprint?
- Expanding Test Coverage: We plan to create more unit tests and execute additional tests for other identified defects. This will ensure broader coverage and better validation of functionality. Improving the robustness of our testing by identifying and testing more edge cases, while also focusing on aspects of error fixing and retesting.
