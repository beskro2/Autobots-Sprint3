# "describe how your test suite evolved moving from a solo to group project"

One of the ways our test suite evolved when moving from a solo project to a group project was that our suite ended up expanding more than we thought It would. If your working alone on
a project the amount test data you can come up with can be very limiting, however when working in a group we quickly saw how fast
our test data and test suites grew.  With each person's contribution, came with different test coverage and edge cases.  With working in group also came with 
the increased risk of merge conflicts in GitHub with our testing suites.  Before any of us worked on the project we all discuss a 
git branching strategy so that we can make sure all of us were on the same page to reduce the risk of merge conflicts within our testing suites.  We ended making our
test suites into separate files so that we wouldn't have to worry about 2 people working on the same file at the same time.  Lastly I would say that we needed our code for the 
test suites to be understandably by everybody working on the project.  When working by yourself its easy to come up with a name for a method that makes sense for you but for 
others it might seem confusing as to why you named a method that way.  Working in a group project we had to be mindful of what we are naming our files,variables,methods.  If we didn't 
then it would be harder on everyone that is working on the project to understand what each file, methods, and variables are doing.
